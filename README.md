# Time
A very simple educative game project developed during my Bachelor studies, aiming to teach kindergarten children the concept of time. It is a plain HTML + CSS + JavaScript project since it was designed to be easily started and run on any machine with a browser by any kindergarten child.
To start the project, simply clone the repository and open the "main.html" file in a browser.
