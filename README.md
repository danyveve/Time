# Time
A very simple educative game project developed during my Bachelor studies, aiming to teach kindergarten children the concept of time. It is a **plain HTML + CSS + JavaScript** project since it was designed to be easily started and run on any machine with a browser by any kindergarten child.

## Application overview
This application is, as previously said, **an educative game designed for kindergarten children** in order to teach them the concept of time through various interactive lessons and games. While playing the game, the child is accompanied by a **friendly narrator, Leo the Cat**, which gives instructions and narrates lessons (only in the Romanian language, since it was designed specifically for a romanian kindergarden from Cluj-Napoca).

The game is structured in **4 parts**, and each of these parts is split into **two sections: a lesson section and a game section** (the latter being accessible only if the former has been completed). Each part of the game teaches the child a different aspect related to the concept of Time, and then assesses his understanding through some interactive games:
* Part 1 
  - lessons about time measurement instruments & the times of the day 
  - game consisting of questions asking which of the presented time measurement instruments can be used to measure / determine the length or the moment of certain actions;
* Part 2:
* Part 3:
* Part 4:
